# To-do List

**This To-do application is developed using the below concepts:**
- HTML for application structure (` h1, input, button, form`).
- Basic CSS for styling the application interface.
- DOM manipulation for creating and removing the tasks (`createElement, appendChild, removeChild`).
- Local storage API for storing the tasks in the memory of the website (`setItem, getItem`).
- Event handling for form submissions and click events (`addEventListener`).

> You can experience the app [live here](https://mani-sankar17.github.io/todo/)
